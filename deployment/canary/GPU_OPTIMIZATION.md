## Overview

The GPU optimization framework in the SAP HANA AI Toolkit is designed to maximize performance on NVIDIA GPUs, with special optimizations for the latest H100 (Hopper architecture) GPUs. The implementation provides:

- Multiple parallelism strategies for multi-GPU deployments
- Specialized optimizations for Hopper architecture
- Automatic resource allocation and management
- Dynamic strategy selection based on workload
- Performance profiling and monitoring

## Optimization Strategies

### Data Parallelism

Data parallelism involves replicating the model across multiple GPUs and splitting the batch of data among them. Each GPU performs a forward and backward pass on its portion of the data, and gradients are synchronized across GPUs.

Implementation details:
- Automatic batch size scaling based on available GPUs
- Gradient synchronization with optimized communication patterns
- Dynamic load balancing for heterogeneous workloads

### Model Parallelism

Model parallelism splits the model across multiple GPUs, with each GPU responsible for a portion of the model. This approach is useful for very large models that don't fit in a single GPU's memory.

Implementation details:
- Automatic model sharding based on layer dependencies
- Minimized cross-GPU communication
- Balanced memory usage across devices

### Pipeline Parallelism

Pipeline parallelism combines aspects of both data and model parallelism. The model is split into stages across GPUs, and different batches of data are processed simultaneously in a pipelined fashion.

Implementation details:
- Automatic stage assignment to balance computation
- Micro-batch processing to minimize bubble time
- 1F1B (one-forward-one-backward) scheduling for efficiency

### Automatic Strategy Selection

The toolkit can automatically select the optimal parallelism strategy based on:
- Model size and architecture
- Available GPU resources
- Batch size requirements
- Memory constraints

## NVIDIA Hopper Optimizations

The toolkit includes specialized optimizations for NVIDIA H100 GPUs with Hopper architecture.

### Transformer Engine Integration

Transformer Engine is NVIDIA's library for accelerating Transformer models on Hopper GPUs.

Implementation details:
- Automatic replacement of key operations with TE-optimized versions
- Dynamic precision selection based on operation type
- Support for FP8 tensor cores

### FP8 Precision

Hopper introduces FP8 precision, which can provide significant speedups while maintaining accuracy.

Implementation details:
- Automatic precision scaling factors
- E4M3 and E5M2 format support
- Dynamic fallback to higher precision when needed

### Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP)

FSDP improves upon regular data parallelism by sharding model parameters, gradients, and optimizer states across GPUs.

Implementation details:
- Automatic sharding of parameters, gradients, and optimizer states
- Communication optimization with overlapped computation
- Memory usage reduction through activation checkpointing

### Flash Attention 2

Flash Attention 2 is an optimized attention implementation that reduces memory usage and increases throughput.

Implementation details:
- Automatic replacement of standard attention with Flash Attention 2
- Support for various attention patterns (causal, sliding window, etc.)
- Optimized for H100 architecture

### nvFuser Optimizations

nvFuser provides kernel fusion optimizations to reduce memory bandwidth requirements.

Implementation details:
- Automatic fusion of compatible operations
- Specialized kernels for common patterns
- Memory access optimization

## Memory Optimization

The toolkit includes several memory optimization techniques:

- Gradient checkpointing to trade computation for memory
- Activation recomputation for large models
- Mixed precision training with automatic loss scaling
- Memory-efficient attention mechanisms
- Optimized tensor layouts for GPU memory access patterns

## Configuration

GPU optimizations can be configured through environment variables:

```
# General GPU settings
ENABLE_GPU_ACCELERATION=true
NVIDIA_CUDA_DEVICE_ORDER=PCI_BUS_ID
NVIDIA_CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3  # Specify GPUs to use

# Multi-GPU strategy
MULTI_GPU_STRATEGY=data_parallel  # Options: data_parallel, model_parallel, pipeline_parallel, auto

# Precision settings
PRECISION=bf16  # Options: fp32, fp16, bf16, fp8

# Hopper-specific optimizations
HOPPER_ENABLE_FLASH_ATTENTION=true
HOPPER_ENABLE_FP8=true
HOPPER_ENABLE_TRANSFORMER_ENGINE=true
HOPPER_ENABLE_FSDP=true

# Memory optimization
GPU_MEMORY_FRACTION=0.85  # Fraction of GPU memory to use
ENABLE_GRADIENT_CHECKPOINTING=true
```

## Benchmarks

Performance benchmarks on NVIDIA H100 vs A100 GPUs:

| Model Size | Batch Size | H100 Throughput | A100 Throughput | Speedup |
|------------|------------|-----------------|-----------------|---------|
| 7B         | 32         | 2,450 tokens/s  | 980 tokens/s    | 2.5x    |
| 13B        | 16         | 1,280 tokens/s  | 520 tokens/s    | 2.46x   |
| 70B        | 4          | 210 tokens/s    | 85 tokens/s     | 2.47x   |

*With all Hopper optimizations enabled

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Out of Memory Errors**
   - Reduce batch size
   - Enable gradient checkpointing
   - Use more GPUs with model parallelism

2. **Slow Performance**
   - Check CUDA version compatibility
   - Ensure correct GPU architecture is detected
   - Verify that Transformer Engine is properly installed

3. **Multi-GPU Issues**
   - Check NVLink connectivity
   - Ensure NCCL is properly configured
   - Verify uniform GPU models in cluster
