## Overview

Canary deployment and failover handling are critical components for ensuring high availability and safe updates in production environments. This implementation provides:

- Gradual rollout of new versions with automatic rollback on failures
- Resilience patterns to handle transient failures
- Comprehensive health monitoring and reporting
- Deployment automation for SAP BTP environments

## Canary Deployment

### What is Canary Deployment?

Canary deployment is a technique that reduces deployment risk by slowly rolling out changes to a small subset of users before making them available to everyone. By releasing software to a subset of users first, issues can be identified and fixed before impacting all users.

### Canary Implementation

The SAP HANA AI Toolkit implements canary deployments with:

1. **Traffic Splitting**: Configurable percentage of traffic routed to canary instances
2. **Health Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of canary performance and error rates
3. **Automatic Rollback**: Immediate rollback when error thresholds are exceeded
4. **Progressive Promotion**: Gradual increase in traffic to canary until full promotion

### Deployment Process

The canary deployment process follows these steps:

1. **Preparation**: Version the new release and prepare deployment artifacts
2. **Initial Deployment**: Deploy canary instance with minimal traffic (e.g., 5-20%)
3. **Monitoring**: Monitor key metrics and compare with production instances
4. **Progressive Promotion**: Gradually increase traffic to canary (e.g., 20% → 50% → 100%)
5. **Full Promotion**: When confident, promote canary to production
6. **Cleanup**: Remove old version once new version is stable

## Failover Handling

### Resilience Patterns

The toolkit implements the following resilience patterns:

1. **Circuit Breaker**: Prevents cascading failures by "breaking the circuit" when failures exceed thresholds
2. **Retry with Backoff**: Automatically retries operations with exponential backoff
3. **Bulkhead**: Isolates components to prevent system-wide failures
4. **Timeout**: Prevents blocking operations from causing overall system slowdown
5. **Fallback**: Provides alternative behavior when primary operations fail

### Failover Implementation

Key components of the failover implementation:

1. **Failover Manager**: Central service that tracks health status of all components
2. **Health Checks**: Regular probes to verify service availability
3. **Circuit State Management**: Tracks and manages circuit breaker states
4. **Service Registry**: Maintains registry of services with their health status

## Configuration

Canary deployment and failover can be configured through environment variables:

```
# Deployment type
DEPLOYMENT_TYPE=canary  # Options: production, canary, development

# Canary settings
CANARY_WEIGHT=20  # Percentage of traffic to route to canary
CANARY_ROLLBACK_THRESHOLD=5  # Number of errors before automatic rollback

# Failover settings
CIRCUIT_BREAKER_THRESHOLD=5  # Failures before opening circuit
CIRCUIT_BREAKER_TIMEOUT=30  # Seconds before attempting to reset circuit
RETRY_COUNT=3  # Maximum retry attempts
RETRY_DELAY=1.0  # Initial delay between retries (seconds)
RETRY_BACKOFF_FACTOR=2.0  # Factor by which delay increases
```

## Monitoring

Monitoring endpoints:

- `/health`: Basic health check endpoint for load balancers
- `/status/failover`: Detailed failover status of all services
- `/status/canary`: Canary deployment status and comparison metrics

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Canary Deployment Fails**: Check logs for errors and validate configuration
2. **Automatic Rollback Triggered**: Examine metrics that triggered rollback
3. **Circuit Breaker Tripping**: Investigate service failures and adjust thresholds if needed
4. **Health Check Failures**: Verify service dependencies and connectivity
